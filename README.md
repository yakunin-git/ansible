### My ansible repository.

Here you will find small recipes for ansible. As well as roles to create more complex tasks. I'll be glad if something is useful to you.
In the main branch there are small recipes for different needs. For roles, I created a separate branch - roles. Feel free to come and have a look.

### Get started.

For disabling fingerprint warnings and questuons, create .ansible.cfg file in your home directory.

```
# cat .ansible.cfg

[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```
